# Swiftbookie AI

Swiftbookie is an AI-powered scheduling platform that makes booking appointments effortless. The integrated AI assistant helps users find the perfect time slots and answers scheduling questions.

## OpenAI Assistant Integration

This application integrates with the OpenAI Assistants API v2 to provide intelligent, conversational responses to users. The implementation includes:

1. **Assistant Creation & Management**: 
   - Creates a custom OpenAI Assistant using GPT-4o on first load
   - Stores the assistant ID in localStorage for persistence
   - Uses existing assistant if already created
   - Compatible with the latest Assistants API v2

2. **Thread Management**: 
   - Creates and manages conversation threads using OpenAI's Thread API
   - Maintains context across messages for coherent conversations
   - Preserves thread history across page refreshes

3. **Message Handling**:
   - Sends user messages to the OpenAI API with proper metadata
   - Retrieves and displays assistant responses with typing indicators
   - Supports different message content types

4. **Error Handling & Performance**:
   - Implements exponential backoff for API polling
   - Provides graceful error handling with user-friendly messages
   - Optimizes API usage to minimize latency
   - Handles API version compatibility

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Chat**: Natural language scheduling assistant using OpenAI's GPT-4o model
- **Calendar Integration**: Google Calendar support for viewing and booking appointments
- **Mobile-Friendly Interface**: Responsive design that works on all devices
- **Conversation History**: Persistent conversation threads that maintain context

## Security Notes

- The OpenAI API key is included directly in the JavaScript code for demonstration purposes only
- In a production environment, API requests should be routed through a secure backend service
- User data and conversation history should be handled according to privacy best practices
